# Rnd_grants

**Summary -**

1. The project aims to develop a web-based platform for managing and tracking research and development grants.

2. The current system relies on manually updating Excel spreadsheets stored on local office computers, which becomes increasingly challenging as the number of projects and files grows.

3. The lack of a centralized system also makes it hard for faculty members and academic office members to access the latest information on specific grants, and generating reports is a time-consuming and complex process.

4. The new system will streamline grant management by providing a user-friendly interface for tracking and reporting grant information.

5. This portal has Google authentication meaning it can only be accessed by the people in this organization.


**The code is confidential and private, so it cannot be shared or made open source.**
