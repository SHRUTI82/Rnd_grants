# Rnd_grants

Summary -
1.The project aims to develop a web-based platform for managing and tracking research and development grants.

2.The current system relies on manually updating Excel spreadsheets stored on local office computers, which becomes increasingly challenging as the number of projects and files grow.

3.The lack of a centralized system also makes it hard for faculty members and academic office members to access the latest information on specific grants, and generating reports is a time-consuming and complex process.

4.The new system will streamline grant management by providing a user-friendly interface for tracking and reporting grant information in real-time.

5.This portal has google authentication which means it can only be accessed by the people in this organisation.


The code is confidential and private, and therefore, it cannot be shared or made open source.
